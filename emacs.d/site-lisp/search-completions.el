;; search-completions
;; Description:  runs isearch in *Completions* buffer, and returns the
;;               completion point is on when the isearch terminates.
;;               Narrows completions interactively with regexp matches.

;;      or
;;
;; (require 'search-completions)
;;
;; This will bind your keys, unless you bind the variable
;; search-completions-dont-bind-my-keys to something non-nil.
;;
;; If you want to change the isearch exit character just for
;; isearch-completions, set the variable isearch-completions-exit-char to
;; the character you want (I like 13, RET).
;;
;; If you want to exit the minibuffer as soon as you exit the search, set
;; the variable isearch-completions-exit to t.  This will have an effect
;; during filename completion only if the filename in the minibuffer is
;; not a directory.
;;
;; This function uses a recursive minibuffer to read the regexp.
;; If enable-recursive-minibuffers is nil, then
;;
;; (setq narrow-completions-enable t)
;;
;; will allow the use of a recursive minibuffer for this function only.
;; If anyone ever autoloads this in a site-init.el, I would recommend that
;; narrow-completions-enable be t, but that narrow-completions be disabled
;; by default.
;;
;; USE:
;; isearch-completions:
;; To search through the completions buffer using isearch, type C-s in the
;; minibuffer window, then use the normal isearch commands to find the
;; completion you want.  If you exit the search with ESC, the completion
;; near point will be put in the minibuffer, if it is the sole completion,
;; the minibuffer will be exited with that value read.  If you decide that
;; you don't want to grab a value from the completions buffer, exit the search
;; using a random control character, the minibuffer will then be selected
;; without changing its contents.
;;
;; narrow-completions:
;; To narrow the possible completions with a regular expression, type
;; C-xC-n in the minibuffer, then type in a regular expression.
;; This will cause only completions matching the regular expression to
;; be considered.  You can recursively narrow the search by typing
;; C-xC-n again, or widen the completion table again by typing C-xC-w.
;; Using a prefix arg means that only completions *not* matching the regexp
;; will be considered.
;;
;; When doing file name completion, subdirectories will be displayed as
;; completions whether they match the current regexp(s) or not.
;;
;; For example, to see all variables with both "buffer" and "window" in
;; their names:
;; C-h v C-x C-n buffer RET C-x C-n window RET TAB
;;
;; To visit a file with a ".c" or ".h" extension:
;; C-x C-f C-n \.[ch] RET SPACE
;;
;; This package also defines the functions read-directory-name and
;; read-file-name-narrowed, for reading file names restricted by a
;; regexp.  See the documentation of those functions for an explanation
;; of how to use them.
;;

;; BUGS:
;; If minibuffer-completion-table is a symbol, i.e. programmed completion,
;; isearch-completions and narrow-completions assume they're doing filename
;; completion.  Programmed completion for some other purpose would probably
;; not work very well with this package.

;; CHANGES:
;; 2003-04-10: lawrence mitchell <wence@gmx.li>
;;   Modified to work with Emacs 21.
;;
;; 17-3-94:
;;   Fixed up the test to see whether isearch was exited normally or
;;   escaped from to work with 19.  (still a disgusting kluge, though)
;; 3-8-93:
;;   Replaced forward-word in isearch-completions-grab with skip-chars-forward,
;;     buffer names with spaces and *'s were confusing it.
;; 2-8-93:
;;   Mods to make this work under lemacs, isearch-forward isn't quite
;;     the same as for gnumacs 19.
;; 31-7-93:
;;   Various emacs-19 compatibility changes -- zap-to-char is different,
;;     the completions buffer is called "*Completions*", isearch has it's
;;     own mode so search-exit-char isn't defined any more.  Added regexp
;;     option.
;; 21-5-93:
;;   Added scrolling functions, cleaned up key-definitions a bit.
;; 8-4-93:
;;   Fixed bug causing isearch-completions to fail for alists if the
;;   string found was not the sole completion by replacing try-completion
;;   with assoc.
;; 1-4-93:
;;   Fixed up key definitions to work with gmhist, suggestion of
;;   Bill Benedetto <benedett@gentire.com>.
;;   Changed function called in isearch-completions to try to create
;;   a completions window to minibuffer-complete from minibuffer-complete-word.
;; 27-3-93:
;;   Added narrow-completions.
;; 21-3-93:
;;   Made isearch-completions exit minibuffer if isearch-completions-option
;;   is non-nil, added isearch-completions-char.
;; 20-3-93:
;;   Added test to see if isearch was terminated "normally".
;;   Removed interactive call, on advice from Dan LaLiberte.
;; 11-3-93:
;;   Changed (erase-buffer) in minibuffer to (zap-to-char -1 ?/)
;;     if completing on file names, after suggestion from Antonio DeSimone.
;;   Added test for proper completion when minibuffer-completion-table is
;;     and alist, fixed up code to do the right thing even if completions
;;     have imbedded spaces, after suggestion from Shiono Junichi.
