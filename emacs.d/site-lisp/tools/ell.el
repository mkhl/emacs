;;; Commentary:
;;
;;  The Emacs Lisp Lisp is available at
;;  http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/sje30/emacs/ell.html
;;
;;  If Stephen changes the layout of his web page, this package may
;;  stop to work correctly.  You may then need to upgrade this
;;  package.

;; After loading this file, just do "M-x ell-packages" to view the
;; list in its own buffer.
;; Use a prefix argument (i.e. "C-u M-x ell-packages") to sort by
;; author name.

;; (New in 1.1)

;; Retrieves information from ell.xml instead of ell.html. Old method relied on
;; regular expressions for parsing and was skipping some entries.

;; (New in 1.0)

;; Packages added to the ELL since the last time you called
;; "ell-packages" will be marked with a tag ("<New>").  This is
;; achieved by storing relevant information about the last time you
;; accessed ELL in a file.  If you delete this file, the next time you
;; access the ELL, all files will be marked as new once more.  If
;; ell-occur-if-new-found is t, an *Occur* buffer will automatically
;; show you the new entries.
;;
;; The elib package is required for cache management (using the
;; avltree facility).  If you do not have elib, get it from any GNU
;; mirror, such as
;; ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/systems/gnu/emacs/elib-1.0.tar.gz
;; 
;; Variables.
;; 
;; Set ell-locate to t (default nil) if you want emacs to
;; indicate which lisp files are already available on your system.
;;
;; Set ell-goto-addr to t (default nil) if you want to turn the
;; URLs into hyperlinks using the goto-addr package.
;;
;; Set ell-last-read-filename to the name of the file where you want
;; to store information from the last time the ELL site was accessed.

;; To Do:
;;
;; + Do the http fetching in the background so emacs is not
;;   freezed on slow connections
;;
;; + Take consideration for the accented character in the sort by
;;   author.
;;
;; + replace sort* with something else so the need for cl.el is
;;   no more required. (is this really necessary?)
;;
;; + Highlight packages already somewhere on your local lisp path.
