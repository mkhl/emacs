;;; Commentary:

;; Defines function `indent-tabs-maybe' for addition to
;; `find-file-hooks'.  Allows setting `indent-tabs-mode' appropriate
;; to the file's existing indentation style.

;;; Code:

(defcustom indent-tabs-maybe-search-size 10000
  "Number of characters from start of buffer within which to look for tabs.
See `indent-tabs-maybe'."
  :group 'indent
  :type 'integer)

(defun indent-tabs-maybe ()
  "Set `indent-tabs-mode' according to buffer contents.
If the current buffer contains a line with a leading tab within the first
`indent-tabs-maybe-search-size' characters, use t, otherwise nil.
Exception: do nothing if buffer is empty.
Intended for use in `find-file-hooks'."
  (when (> (point-max) 1)
    (save-excursion
      (save-restriction
	(widen)
	(goto-char 1)
	(if (re-search-forward "^\t" indent-tabs-maybe-search-size t)
	    (setq indent-tabs-mode t)
	  (setq indent-tabs-mode nil))))))

;; Have it show up in the right place under Custom.
(put 'find-file-hooks 'custom-options
     (cons 'indent-tabs-maybe (get 'find-file-hooks 'custom-options)))

(provide 'indent-tabs-maybe)
